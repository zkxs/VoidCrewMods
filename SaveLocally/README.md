# Save Locally

Always saves your player profile locally. This doesn't really do anything useful, except in one case: if you were
to play in internet mode for a while and later switch to LAN mode, without this mod you start from scratch. With this
mod you start from your last internet save.

This mod isn't really ready to use yet: I'm mostly just using it to poke around with the profile save format.
