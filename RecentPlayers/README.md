# Void Crew Recent Players

A mod for [Void Crew](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063420/Void_Crew/) that populates the Steam overlay's recent players section with players you've been in a lobby with.

## Manual Installation

1. Install [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) into your Void Crew game folder. This mod is NOT made for
   BepInEx 6.
2. Add [RecentPlayers.dll](https://github.com/zkxs/VoidCrewRecentPlayers/releases/latest/download/RecentPlayers.dll) to your BepInEx `plugins`
   folder. If `plugins` doesn't exist, simply create the folder inside your `BepInEx` folder.

If you did everything correctly, you should have `RecentPlayers.dll` at this location:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Void Crew\BepInEx\plugins\RecentPlayers.dll` (at least for a typical Steam
install).
